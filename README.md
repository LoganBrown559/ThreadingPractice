# ThreadingPractice
By Logan Brown

This was... interesting. All is does is use threads to calcute an estimate of Pi. This took longer than it should have, probably because of my inexpierience with threads.
One of the biggest issues is my double Pi was coming out to zero, turns out I had to cast a lot of the integers to doubles in order to get it to calculate correctly.
Even though I had issues, I really did think this assignmen was cool.
